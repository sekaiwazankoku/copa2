# Copa Cross Traffic Attack

This repository simulates a cross-traffic attack on the Copa Congestion Control Algorithm (CCA). The setup includes a sender-receiver pair, where the sender logs its behavior and acknowledgment (ACK) rate. The attacker sender first launches a volumetric attack before transitioning to a custom attack phase determined by configurable parameters: `burst duration`, `burst size`, and `burst interval`.

## Features
- Simulates a cross-traffic attack on the Copa CCA.
- Provides logging functionality for analyzing sender behavior and ACK rates.
- Configurable attack parameters for fine-tuned testing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Compiler**: `g++`
- **Operating System**: Linux-based environment recommended.

### Cloning the Repository
Clone the repository using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sekaiwazankoku/copaCrossTrafficAttack.git
cd copaCrossTrafficAttack
```

### Building the Project
This repository includes a `Makefile` to build the required binaries. Use the following steps:

1. Build the `sender` binary:
   ```bash
   make sender
   ```

2. Build the `receiver` binary:
   ```bash
   make receiver
   ```

### Installing Binaries
Once compiled, the binaries should ideally be moved to `/usr/local/bin` for easy access. You can also create symlinks for convenience:

```bash
sudo mv sender /usr/local/bin/
sudo mv receiver /usr/local/bin/

sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/sender /usr/bin/sender
sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/receiver /usr/bin/receiver
```

### Usage

The binaries `sender` and `receiver` can be used to launch the simulation.

#### Sender
- The `sender` binary logs its behavior and ACK rate during the attack.
- Volumetric and custom attack phases can be configured via parameters.

#### Receiver
- The `receiver` binary simulates a recipient of the traffic generated by the sender.

## Configurable Parameters
The attack is configured using the following parameters:
- **Burst Duration**: Duration of each attack burst.
- **Burst Size**: Size of the packets in the burst.
- **Burst Interval**: Time interval between successive bursts.

## Cleaning Up
To clean up compiled files, run:
```bash
make clean
```

This will remove all binaries and object files.

## Logging and Plotting
The sender binary includes built-in logging functionality to track attack behavior. Logs can be used to analyze and plot metrics such as:
- Sender behavior over time.
- ACK rate variations.
